## PyCon 2021

I gave a talk during the Education Summit as well as (soon to be done)
a lightning talk. Both were about [friendly](https://github.com/aroberge/friendly).

I had first prepared an even [longer version](https://github.com/aroberge/talks/blob/master/pycon-2021/Introducing%20friendly_long.pdf) of the Education Summit talk.
I [recorded a test video](https://youtu.be/e8G1Nr8P504) which made me realize
that I needed to cut a lot of material from this longer version.
